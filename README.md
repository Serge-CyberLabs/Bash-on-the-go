# Bash-on-the-go
Learning Bash and Linux basics using iSH (Alpine Linux) in small, daily moments.

📘 How I Learned Bash on the Go (Using iSH)

⸻

Why This Repo Exists

I didn’t always have the luxury of sitting at home with a laptop and hours of uninterrupted study time.

Most of my learning happened:
	•	on work breaks
	•	waiting for coffee or lunch
	•	sitting in the car
	•	at the airport

Instead of letting those moments go to waste, I looked for a way to stay consistent — even in small windows of time. That’s when I started using iSH, a lightweight Linux terminal app for iOS.

iSH gave me a real command-line environment in my pocket. It wasn’t perfect, but it was real enough to help me build familiarity, confidence, and muscle memory with Bash and Linux basics.

🛠 Why iSH?

iSH runs Alpine Linux, which makes it:
	•	fast
	•	minimal
	•	strict (in a good way)

That strictness forced me to:
	•	understand file permissions
	•	learn why scripts don’t run
	•	pay attention to shebangs
	•	slow down and actually read errors

In other words, it didn’t let me “fake it.”

🧠 My Learning Approach

Instead of trying to memorize commands or follow long tutorials, I took a rebuild-first approach.

Here’s what that looked like:
	1.	Find a very simple Bash script
	2.	Break it apart line by line
	3.	Ask: What does this line actually do?
	4.	Delete it
	5.	Rebuild it manually
	6.	Run it
	7.	Break it again
	8.	Fix it

I wasn’t trying to be fast — I was trying to be clear.

🧱 Understanding the Script Skeleton

Almost every Bash script I practiced followed the same basic structure:

#!/bin/sh

# Comments explaining what the script does

echo "Hello, world"

I learned to recognize:
	•	the shebang (what interpreter runs the script)
	•	comments (for humans, not the machine)
	•	commands (what actually executes)

Once I could recognize that skeleton, scripts stopped looking intimidating — they became readable.

🧪 Practicing in Small Moments

Because iSH lived on my phone, I could:
	•	open it for 5–10 minutes
	•	type commands by hand
	•	re-run scripts from memory
	•	experiment without fear of “breaking my system”

Those small moments added up.

Consistency mattered more than comfort.

📂 What You’ll Find in This Repo
	•	Beginner Bash scripts I rebuilt by hand
	•	Scripts tested specifically in iSH / Alpine Linux
	•	Clear comments explaining why each line exists
	•	Mistakes I made (and fixed) along the way

If you’re new to Bash or Linux, you don’t need a full lab to start — just curiosity and consistency.

✝️ A Personal Note

I’ve learned that faithfulness in small things matters.

Learning this way taught me patience, discipline, and humility — skills that matter just as much in tech as they do in life.

“Whoever is faithful in little is faithful also in much.” — Luke 16:10
